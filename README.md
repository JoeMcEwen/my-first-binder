# my-first-binder
A lesson on Fourier series for first year physics class. 
Currently this version is very new. I am testing this lesson out. This will need many iterations to reach an acceptable level. 

Go to https://mybinder.org/ . 

At the first entry (GitHub repository name or URL)  put in https://github.com/JoeMcEwen/my-first-binder. It will take some time to build.
